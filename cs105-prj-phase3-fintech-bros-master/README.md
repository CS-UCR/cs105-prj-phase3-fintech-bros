# Summary of the Data Analysis Process Performed

I first cleaned the data by deleting any null rows and converting all the headlines to strings and all the numbers to floats. 

# Results and Observations Obtained

Something that was revealed within the data was that there isn't that much of a correlation between the positivity/negativity of the news and whether it is an up day or a down day. There is a slight edge in the market, however, when the news is negative. This slight edge being that the stock is slightly more likely to have an up day when the news is negative. I conclude from this that the stock has been down for a couple of days due to a couple days of bad news thus leading to a "discounted stock" that is more appealing to buy to investors. This increase in the amount of stcoks bought on that day would thus lead to an increase in the price of the stock. As for positive news, investors usually sell their stocks at a high, or when they think the stock is above its value. This then leads to a drop in the price of the stock due to a high frequency of sells. All in all, I believe that the news slightly effects the stock prices, but not that much. Many of the stock ups and downs are due to a majority of people just wanting to buy or sell based on the price. The stock market is just based off of the amount of stocks bought and sold, and not of news so it is logical to deduce that the news has no effect unless it directly has to do with that specific stock.
